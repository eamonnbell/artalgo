We are excited to announce a new reading group on art and algorithms this fall for the Columbia community. We are looking to recruit a diverse set of students to discuss and debate the technical and critical issues surrounding algorithms that generate art. There is no leader or instructor; instead we will learn from each other. The reading group will consist of approximately 15 advanced undergraduates and graduate students.

The reading group, “Making art in an age of algorithms: Critical readings across the disciplines”, will meet five times on the Morningside campus in the evening during the fall semester. Our activities will culminate in a public symposium to be held at Columbia in December 2018, featuring short presentations by participants, a discussion, and a keynote speaker. 

By reading around both the technical details and debates involving algorithms that generate art—text, audio (music), image, and video—we will learn how the growing body of literature on critical algorithm studies can be improved using the specialist knowledge from our respective disciplines.

Dinner will be provided at each meeting. Notes from the reading group will eventually form part of a publicly accessible website hosting a record of the group’s activities.
