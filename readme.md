# Arts & Algorithms

Arts & Algorithms is a cross-disciplinary reading group held at Columbia University in the fall of 2018. This repository, and the website it produces, serves as a public record of our readings and discussions.

You can access the website directly: blackbox.cs.columbia.edu

All readings will be stored in the `/readings` directory, while notes from our discussions are stored as markdown files in the `/_posts` directory; the notes are also available directly on the website.

This project is run by Eamonn Bell and Katy Gero.

This project is supported by funding from the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University, under the Seed Grants for Interdisciplinary Research program.
