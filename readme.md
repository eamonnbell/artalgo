# Arts & Algorithms

Arts & Algorithms is a cross-disciplinary reading group held at Columbia University in the fall of 2018. This repository, and the website it produces, serves as a public record of our readings and discussions.

## Lightweight Code of Conduct

Codes of conduct can be useful when creating intentional learning communities. Here is ours.

Inspired by codes of conduct from [Code Societies](https://github.com/SFPC/codesocieties/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md), [SFPC](https://github.com/SFPC/codeofconduct/blob/master/README.md), and the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct).

- Please be respectful of each others’ time by being on time.
- Some people tend to talk a lot and some people don’t; if you tend to talk a lot challenge yourself to listen more and if you tend to talk less challenge yourself to talk more. In both cases, embrace awkward silences.
- Don’t act surprised when people say or indicate they don't know something, e.g. "You don't know who RMS is?!" We’re here to learn from each other, not put each other down for our differences. 

These [Principles of Conversation](https://twitter.com/andrew_zolli/status/476360075398119424) from Andrew Zolli are a good guiding compass:

- together we know more
- be tough on ideas gentle on people
- avoid jargon
- threads beat points
- proceed with generosity
