## A Cross-Disciplinary Reading Group

We are excited to announce a new reading group on art and algorithms this fall for the Columbia community. We are looking to recruit a diverse set of students to discuss and debate the technical and critical issues surrounding algorithms that generate art. There is no leader or instructor; instead we will learn from each other. The reading group will consist of approximately 15 advanced undergraduates and graduate students.

Notes from our meetings are below.
