# A Cross-Disciplinary Reading Group

This website serves as a public record for a reading group on art and algorithms being held this fall 2018 for the Columbia community. On this page you'll find an overview of five meetings held, as well as links to in-depth notes for our discussions.

* [Meeting 1](#m1) (19 September 2018)
* [Meeting 2](#m2) (3 October 2018)
* [Meeting 3](#m3) (24 October 2018)
* [Meeting 4](#m4) (7 Nov 2018)
* [Meeting 5](#m5) (28 Nov 2018)

All meetings take place on Wednesdays, from 7-9pm.

### Meeting 1: "Algorithm"

This meeting introduces participants to various definitions of “algorithm,” from historical to contemporary mathematics and from computer science. Readings will be chosen to reflect multiple understandings of the term but also to serve as concrete examples of the diversity of modes of argument, standards of proof, notations, and intellectual priorities within the scientific and artistic communities.

* Striphas, “[Algorithmic Culture](https://github.com/kgero/artalgo/_site/readings/Algorithmic_culture.pdf)”
* Cormen et al., “[The Role of Algorithms in Computing](https://github.com/kgero/artalgo/_site/readings/The_Role_of_Algorithms_in_Computing.pdf)”
* Karpathy, “[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)”

Additionally, we’ve selected some pre-computer artwork that is algorithmic in nature to peruse:


* James Tenney, [August Harp for Susan Allen (1971)](https://youngcomposersproject.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/august-harp.png) [[recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x34hUbPswt4)]
* [Sol Lewitt Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/)
* Tristan Tzara, [TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM (1920)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Pour-faire-un-poeme-dadaiste.jpg) [[implementation](http://www1.lasalle.edu/~blum/c340wks/DadaPoem.htm)]

### Meeting 2: Garbage in; garbage out?

Some generative models of art require large amounts of training data (in this case, pre-existing artworks) before they can be used effectively. If this training data is of poor quality or does not accurately represent the domain being modeled, the algorithm may fail to produce convincing outputs. Readings will capture the difficulty of arriving at intersubjectively acceptable criteria for evaluating the quality of both input data and generated output.

### Meeting 3: Artificial interlocutors

Artists and corporations have used artificial interlocutors in their live performances, installations, and advertising campaigns, raising interesting questions about agency and artistic identity in an age of algorithms. Conversational agents also lie at the heart of a growing number of communication systems: customer support lines, chatbots, and voice recognition interfaces. Readings in this meeting will explore what artists have learned from the creation of algorithmic collaborators and what designers of conversational agents can learn from the study of art.

### Meeting 4: Everything new is old

Recognizing the iterative nature of research entails reckoning with its history of provisional and failed attempts to produce art algorithmically. Readings will examine how the resuscitation of “old science” is facilitated by the appearance of new applications and, relatedly, how classical (and potentially problematic) applications and evaluation regimes—canonical generative task framings, old datasets, and competitions—are used to legitimize new algorithmic arts.

### Meeting 5: Opening black boxes

Contemporary technological developments mean that decisions made by many kinds of algorithms cannot be always be simply interpreted as a chain of reasoning leading from input to output. Readings explore the concept of “interpretation” in both the statistical and hermeneutic sense, and will examine whether new algorithmic techniques ought to cause us to update our understanding of closely related concepts: causality, explanation, explainability, and even moral accountability.
